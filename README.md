# Capstone-Project

## Top-down shooter survival game (WIP)
This is a project that I started and worked on by myself for my Senior Capstone project at CSUF. This project is currently unfinished, but I've created and uploaded a small demo of what the game is like.
This is a work in progress, so I hope I'll be able to provide updates and actually find the time to polish the game.
This project was created in GameMaker Studio. I had a Pro key that I obtained from Humble Bundle in 2016, so I said I might as well use it for a cool project.
Unfortunately, I underestimated the workload and time needed to develop a game fully, so the current outcome was far from what I had envisioned.
Below is a brief explanation of how to install the game. 

### Installation Guide

1. Download the .zip folder.
1. Export all contents of the folder wherever you'd like.
1. Run the .exe file to play the game.
