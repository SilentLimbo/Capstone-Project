# Capstone-Project
This is a project that I started and worked on by myself for my Senior Capstone project at CSUF. 
This project is currently unfinished, but I've created and uploaded a small demo of what the game is like.
In future patches, I will upload newer versions of the game as I develop. 

## Top-down shooter survival game (WIP)
This is a work in progress, so I hope I'll be able to provide updates and actually find the time to polish the game.
This project was created in GameMaker Studio. I obtained a Pro key from Humble Bundle in 2016, so I said I might as well use it for a cool project.
Unfortunately, I underestimated the workload and time needed to develop a game fully, so the current outcome was far from what I had envisioned.
Below is a brief explanation of how to install the game. 

### Installation Guide
1. Download the .zip folder.
1. Export all contents of the folder wherever you'd like.
1. Run the .exe file to play the game.

### Controls
The game currently only has one set of controls, which involves a mouse and keyboard.
1. "wasd" functions as movement keys.
1. Left mouse click is to shoot (can tap or hold).
1. Right mouse click is to swap weapons.
